# Top Songs (React / Redux)

### A single page application that displays top songs based on iTunes chart categories and countries, and allows users to watch & control YouTube videos of these songs.

#### Features Include:
* User can tailor the top song results, by selecting different:

  * music categories (e.g., Pop, Rock, Country, etc.),
  * countries (e.g., US, France, etc.), and
  * number of songs to display (Top 5, 10, 15, etc.)
* User can control the music videos using buttons outside of the YouTube Player (e.g., pause, play, mute, previous, next).
* Ensures more than one video does not play at a time (to reduce audio issues). That is, automatically pauses a playing video when another is played.
* Automatically plays the next video, when the previous video ends.
* User can click a button to view a musician's bio.
